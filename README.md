#### I. Project Title
**Optimizing Classification Performance in Handwriting EEG Data**

---

#### II. Project Introduction

##### Objective
The primary objective is to improve classification performance of EEG signals during handwriting tasks. This will be achieved through the utilization of advanced neural network architectures and machine learning techniques.

##### Motivation
The project aims to advance the field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) by enhancing the classification accuracy of EEG signals associated with handwriting. The improved accuracy could facilitate various applications such as medical diagnostics and enhanced human-computer interactions.

#### III. Dataset Description

The dataset is based on EEG and handwriting data from a single participant (P1). Labels correspond to the first pen-down events for each letter and punctuation in the sentence 'HELLO, WORLD!' The test dataset for model evaluation will only include input EEG data.
S1: 'H'
S2: 'E'
S3: 'L' (first 'L')
S4: 'L' (second 'L')
S5: 'O' (first 'O')
S6: ','
S7: 'W'
S8: 'O' (second 'O')
S9: 'R'
S10: 'L' (third 'L')
S11: 'D'
S12: '!'
